# zorl
This repository contains the code of ZoRL, an adaptive discretization-based reinforcement learning algorithm for average reward MDPs. The performance of ZoRL is compared against the following algorithms:
1. PZRL, an adaptive discretization-based heuristic algorithm.
2. UCRL2, applied on uniformly discretized MDP.
3. TSDE, applied on uniformly discretized MDP.
4. RVI-Q, Q-learning on uniformly discretized MDP.

* Here is a list of python libraries that are needed to run the code.
1. Python                             3.9.18
2. matplotlib                         3.8.0
3. numpy                              1.24.3
4. scipy                              1.11.3
5. seaborn                            0.12.2
6. torch                              1.11.0
